Please put across the difficulties we faced due to the length of the paper so that we may be awarded grace marks, or leniency may be maintained during checking
03/04/21, 11:21 am - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: Its really unfair for us 
Because writing python code of 50-60 lines on paper and 8 questions in 1 hr is just impossible and sence less
03/04/21, 11:21 am - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: Sense*
03/04/21, 11:22 am - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: And we dont have to learn code by heart
03/04/21, 11:23 am - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: Even we have known the codes for all the questions 
Its impossible to write it on paper in the given time
03/04/21, 11:24 am - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: And also while writing the code by hand 
How can we be so sure that our code have no errors and it is running well 
It is not a 5-6 line logic that we can be 100% sure

03/04/21, 12:06 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: sorry maam but 1 more thing 
we got to know from many students that 
in other batchs there was no such rule that we need to submit hand written answers 
everyone just typed the coding part and added the images and hand written the theory part of the question
03/04/21, 12:14 pm - Jeyaselvi Ma'am APP: Sahaj it's Cycle test we have to write only.
Exam should be in handwritten only.
03/04/21, 12:16 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: Yes maam we understood 
But what i am saying is 
In todays paper 
Other batch students have typed the code and pasted the screenshot of that code 
And thet have written the theory part of answer with hand
03/04/21, 12:16 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: Like it was easy for them
03/04/21, 12:16 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: And they will get more marks
03/04/21, 6:22 pm - Vaibhav SRM Fbd: Ma'am, are there any updates regarding this?

code is right and u give 5, somewhere 6 marks.


Feels like marks have been given randomly
15/04/21, 2:14 pm - Kushagra Gupta CR SRM: Yes maam, I wrote the whole code correctly still got 7/8..
15/04/21, 2:14 pm - +91 84294 46644: why 5/8
15/04/21, 2:14 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: maam we need to know how are marks are been cut
15/04/21, 2:15 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: 2 page correct ans and 6 markjs
15/04/21, 2:15 pm - +91 84294 46644: full code is correct still 5 marks. Why marks have been cut then ???
maam can u please tell ??
15/04/21, 2:17 pm - Jeyaselvi Ma'am APP: Dear Students
Kindly have privately I will tell everyone where you have went wrong
15/04/21, 2:22 pm - Jeyaselvi Ma'am APP: Dear Students
I will get back to the posted queries one by one after my class
15/04/21, 2:38 pm - Vaibhav SRM Fbd: Ma'am, so you basically took questions that we wrote as 5 markers, and evaluated them out of 8. You should remember that we attempted all the question in the time provided. 

In that, you gave us 6/8 in almost all the questions we have written to the best of our ability. And not hesitated to cut marks at all.

I made sure i wrote as many answers as i could because 4*8 > 5*5.

[ 4*8 - if i would get 4/5 in 8 questions & 5*5 - if i got 5/5 but could only complete 5 questions ]

We were not aware of the marking scheme, at the point of writing the exam.

I have respect for you ma'am, but considering how lengthy the exam was, how stressful it was for us, and how expect us to cooperate but ruthlessly cut our marks... all this is very harsh on us ma'am. I got 39/50. Your department set a horrible question paper, and you award us marks as if we wrote 8 markers and cut our marks if the answers aren't perfect. Didn't expect this from you considering how much you value cooperation.

15/04/21, 9:35 pm - Aditya Srm Classmate: Yes ma'am, practical classes and modern evolution are baseless,if we are gonna write code on paper and you are going to check codes without compiler
15/04/21, 9:36 pm - Kushagra Gupta CR SRM: Yes ma'am, we should get full marks for codes that are correct and working, there is no point in deducting marks. This is coding exam not and english marks where you can cut marks however you want maam.
15/04/21, 9:36 pm - Kushagra Gupta CR SRM: For that matter of fact we haven't been provided with answer key and academia portal to upload marks closes tomorrow maam please help us
15/04/21, 9:37 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: I guess tests are more focused on how students can be more stressed and less time lengthy papers. And how we dont get good marks
15/04/21, 9:37 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: So that our cgpa cant be better then last sem
15/04/21, 9:37 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: And we wont get scholarships
15/04/21, 9:38 pm - Kushagra Gupta CR SRM: Your inactions are causing us monetary losses maam, this isnt just marks for us
15/04/21, 9:38 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: I lost 70k last sem
15/04/21, 9:38 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: And many students even lost in lakhs
15/04/21, 9:39 pm - +91 84294 46644: And please also if u don't have to give marks then don't give.....

We already shit of things to deal in life. We, can't just talk and discuss whole day for marks we rightly deserve. We are already suffering from what not and then the college authorities who shoulf be cooperating...are only giving more stress and worsening our mental length!
I am done with this!
15/04/21, 9:39 pm - Aditya Srm Classmate: Yes ma'am,try to imagine if all the big companies started doing this....in place of coding interviews,they make us write code on paper
15/04/21, 9:40 pm - Aditya Srm Classmate: Ma'am show me one wise person, who would recommend this??
15/04/21, 9:40 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: For this maam 
Can you write code on paper 
Without syntax errors and anyother error?
Is this how coding should be tested
15/04/21, 9:40 pm - Sahaj Kaari 403 AI: Idk how are we gonna learn all this

31/07/21, 2:16 pm - Sneha Maam FA: Greetings from CIDC

It gives me immense pleasure to inform you that CIDC has initiated a National Level Internship Program (NLIP) in accordance to the MoU with ECI and AICTE for cultivating fresh engineers for industry ready roles. The initiative has become imperative as AICTE has mandated compulsory internship training for all engineering students from 2017-18 batch, but the required ecosystem to cater for this is still to be developed.

Under this program, CIDC would be assisting various AICTE approved Engineering Colleges and Universities, that have signed MoUs with CIDC, and interested individual students, in securing exposure of practices and processes adopted in Indian Industry.

Such assistance would include conducting lectures, both physical as well as online, and physical site visits, both short term (1-2 days), as well as site deputations ranging between 1 to 6 months.

With this letter we would like to apprise you of this important nation building initiative and seek your indulgence in this initiative by way of participating in lectures to guide students, and allowing students to undertake internships at your plants/sites. A line of confirmation along with possibilities of your participation in one or more of these activities would be quite helpful and therefore requested.
31/07/21, 2:16 pm - Sneha Maam FA: Dear All 
Kindly forward it to all your students, interested students can apply
31/07/21, 2:16 pm - Sneha Maam FA: Dear Colleagues,
The various scholarship schemes are open on the student portal of E-Varsity, for the fresh / renewal of scholarships, for the AY 2021-2022.  The last date for applying is 5:00 PM (SRMIST server time) on 15/08/2021.

Please note that whatever minimum criteria that are fixed for a scholarship is only for the eligibility to apply. Satisfying the minimum criteria doesn't mean that the student must get the scholarship. As you are all aware, scholarships are awarded on a highly competitive basis and only for the highly deserving students. The threshold / cut-off CGPA will be decided by the scholarship committee based on the academic credentials of all the students who have applied for a particular category of scholarship.  Applications without proper supporting documents, wherever needed, will be summarily rejected. The decision of the scholarship committee is final and binding.

‚û°Ô∏è 3. Students' needs to address their mental health challenges.

The survey will take you 10-15 minutes to complete. Participation in this survey is voluntary. All the information given by you will be kept confidential and only used for research and action purposes within SRM IST only.

I recommend that the departments handling common courses shall send their schedule first to the offered departments, based on which the offered departments shall schedule the tests for the remaining courses.

Request all HoDs to ensure that appropriate Covid SOPs are strictly adhered to during the conduct of cycle tests.

The above supersedes the test schedule already circulated by Dr. Nandakumar.

If there are any concerns in the above procedure do let me know quickly, before we communicate to all students and faculty.

31/10/21, 1:59 pm - Sneha Maam FA: Dear IndoML 2020 participant,

Hope this email finds you in good health. We are writing to inform you about the IndoML 2021 (a pan-India ML symposium) and its associated hackathon event (aka Datathon).
In keeping with the theme and our central objective to involve students, IndoML 2021 has a new initiative -- a month-long Datathon -- aimed toward giving students exposure to machine learning through a problem-oriented approach. With the help of experts from academia and industry, we have curated four different datasets and corresponding problem statements (more information in the attached flyer and Datathon Kaggle Page). These range from problems e.g. entity recognition in a code-switching dataset to relation extraction of Indian Languages, to question-answering tasks, to abuse detection in Indian languages. The problems will be made open to a month-long challenge to students from India and abroad (a short description of the challenges is given below). We plan to provide cash prizes to the winners of the datathon and would also invite them to speak in the main online symposium. Across all the challenges the participants would have an opportunity to win prizes worth up to INR 3.5 Lacs (generously sponsored by ACM India and Microsoft Research). In order to participate please register immediately in Kaggle as well as on the symposium website here.

Apart from the lucrative prize and an opportunity to work on industry-relevant challenges, we also have an excellent list of top-tier expert speakers such as Professors Ray Mooney, Chris Potts, and Michael Bronstein; who exemplify different aspects of the IndoML 2021 theme.

We will be absolutely grateful if you can take part or help us spread the news about this event and make the IndoML datathon 2021 a leading ML hack event in India.

Reiterating Kindly note, to be eligible for the prize, participating teams should register both here and on Kaggle.

*Apologies if you have received multiple copies of this mail.

Dear Mr. Kartar Singh

 

Greetings from La Trobe University!

It‚Äôs my pleasure to extend the invite to your prestigious institute to participate in La Trobe university ‚ÄúTechnology Infusion Grand Challenge‚Äù which promises to stimulate student‚Äôs technical and analytical skills. We have always believed in creating an opportunity for students by organizing national and international competitions.

We are delighted to inform you that entries will open from Monday 15th November 2021 to an annual innovation competition for students called The Technology Infusion Grand Challenge.

https://latrobe.edu.au/grandchallenge.

This competition is open to students in their final two years of undergraduate studies in Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics and/or Business Studies. This competition provides a great opportunity for students to showcase their talents and gain exposure on the global stage. Taking part in the competition is free of charge and selected student teams could also receive an investment of up to $1000 to develop their prototype. If appropriate, the project entry could also be part of student academic work for example a major or final year team project.

 

The winner of the competition will be awarded an all-expense paid mentorship stay in Melbourne to work at the Centre for Technology Infusion, La Trobe Accelerator Program,  La Trobe School of Engineering and Mathematical Sciences and the La Trobe Business School.

 

It would be of great assistance if you could kindly circulate attached brochure and invitation letter within your esteemed institution. I would request you to keep following email id in cc in order for the Grand Challenge Team to follow up when required: grandchallenge@latrobe.edu.au

 

Yours Sincerely,

Shweta

 If any of you are interested in knowing more about the product development club, joining it or working on mobile and web development projects please do join this group:

Link: https://chat.whatsapp.com/G1hEGmMylqXG7wEAwoyEX1

The product development club is an initiative to help students become better at developing real world applications focused more on web development & mobile app development. The work we get/plan on getting ranges from internal projects to free lance work that may include a stipend as well. We aim to maximise the number of projects we get to allow students to get an insight into how the Industry functions. Our goal is to build a community where people can collaborate, work with, and help each other out. We wish to provide a platform and some guidance and direction for students to become better software developers who are capable of building secure, sustainable, effective and high performance applications. Furthermore the club also brings like-minded students together to be able to participate in Hackathons, Competitions and do Projects Together. If students have any ideas (Startups or Project Ideas), We can get the students the right resources and guidance to be successful in pursuing that path as well. Being a part of the Product Development Club  will equip students with a skillset that will stay with them for a long time and help them be prepared for the dynamic technological environment.

As of now we have received a stipend based project from Ardent Sports. It is to develop a Mobile Application - details about the application will be given to those people working on the project.

We will have a google meet soon to answer any questions you guys may have and we will keep you updated on the group so please join the group mentioned at the beginning  of the message... Feel free to reach out for any queries and if any of your friends are interested in Mobile or Web Development (1st 2nd 3rd 4th Years) please do share this with them and tell them to join the group

https://forms.gle/auW7EjwKVtcwXbUh7

This is the recruitment form for the upcoming project(s) - Please fill it if you guys are interested... We will hold interviews soon and update you on the selection process. We are looking forward to working with you guys!
